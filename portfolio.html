            <hr>
            <p class="text-center" style="line-height: 50px;">I was born and raised in the great state of Nebraska. I lived there my whole life up until about 6 months ago.
                While in Nebraska I participated in track and basketball throughout high school. I continued to run track
                in college which was a great experience for me and taught me many things. After leaving college I wasn't
                sure what my next step was and moved back home. During these years I worked several jobs including serving
                at restaurants and working for Frito-Lay. After realizing I didn't enjoy these type of jobs I have now decided
                to pursue a career in web development.

            <p class="text-center" style="line-height: 50px">I have several hobbies that include fishing, sports, gaming, and working out. I started fishing a couple years
                ago and have been obsessed ever since. My favorite sports teams include the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Kansas
                City Chiefs, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Sporting KC. When it comes to gaming I enjoy first person shooters
                and sports games. If I'm not doing one of the three things above then I am most likely working out. I find
                it to be not only great for my physical health but my mental health.</p>
